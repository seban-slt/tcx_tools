TCX-Tools
=========
This is very simple & lame python code, I never programmed in Python so this is an experiment, maybe it can learn me something new? ;)

At this moment it is just one simple python script, but in future probably I add the CAS to TCX converter. If this can help people from Atari community I also probably write a simple copy program for 8-bit Atari that can remove the protection, and can convert protected files into plain DOS files again.

The disassembled source code of loader will be published later, when I make some code cleanup, and add some comments.

Technical Info
--------------

`tcx_rle_decoder.py` is Turbo Copy 3/Turbo Copy 4 data stream analyzer & decompressor. This simple script was created to  to extract files from old tape images, that was recovered and shared by various people on atari.area and atarionnlie forums.

 The data structure is "guessed" from loader code,  I'm not sure this will be correct for all cases  I have only a few example files, and because those files was generated by __Turbo Copy 3 or Turbo Copy 4__, so the file extension TCX was selected for those files.
 
 __Turbo Copy 3/4__ was a program for 8-bit Atari machines that can copy plain Atari DOS executable files to tape. The copy program also protests the saved file by generating a one shorter record (6 bytes) before the rest of data records, so that's kind of generated recordings can't be copied by any standard copy program. The saved data can be also encrypted by simple XOR function (all data stream is xor-ed by single byte key). The data stream is also compressed by simple RLE algorithm with use od two escape codes 0xBF, 0xCF. If the 0xBF byte is found in input data stream then the loader gets next byte that is number of repetition of zero byte in output stream. When 0XCF byte is found by the loader in the input stream then the loader gets next two bytes, one is number of repetitions and the second one is repeated byte.
 
 This simple python script can decompress that type of stream, and can de-xor the stream, also script can detect the XOR key value when key is not given (the XOR key byte is normally stored in loader code, but TCX files don't have that information because it can be easy restored from header of input stream data).
 
 The files that I have from people also have some garbage at the end of data, scripts detects it and remove the additional bytes. The example files can't be added to this repo, because I don't want violate any copyrights rights. It can be easly found on the the network.

Running the code
----------------

Code is written in Python. I used 3.8.2 version to test, run this simple code. It was testes under Debian/Linux and Windows7 with Python 3.8.2 installed. To run just type `python3 tcx_rle_decoder.py input_file [XOR key byte (hex notation]`
